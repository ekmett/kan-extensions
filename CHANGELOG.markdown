5.2.6 [2024.05.04]
------------------
* Drop support for GHC 8.2 and earlier.
* Generalize instances in `Control.Monad.Codensity` to be of the form:

  ```hs
  instance (f ~~ f', MonadFail f') => MonadFail (Codensity (f :: k -> TYPE rep))
  ```

  This avoids having to constrain `k ~ Type` and `rep ~ LiftedRep`, which could potentially harm type inference.
* Explicitly implement `liftA2` in the `Applicative` instance for `Data.Functor.Day.Curried`.
* Add an `Adjunction` instance for `Data.Functor.Day`.
* Add `Adjunction` and `Divisible` instances for `Data.Functor.Contravariant.Day`.
* Add an `Apply` instance for `Data.Functor.Day.Curried`.

5.2.5 [2022.06.26]
------------------
* Only require a `Functor` constraint in the `Eq` and `Ord` instances for
  `Coyoneda` when building against `transformers-0.4.*`.

5.2.4 [2022.05.07]
------------------
* Allow building with `transformers-0.6.*` and `mtl-2.3.*`.

5.2.3 [2021.07.27]
------------------
* Add `shift` and `reset` to `Control.Monad.Codensity`.

5.2.2 [2021.02.17]
------------------
* Add `hoistCoyoneda` to `Data.Functor.Contravariant.Coyoneda`.

5.2.1 [2020.10.01]
------------------
* Allow building with GHC 9.0.

5.2 [2018.07.03]
----------------
* Make `Codensity` levity polymorphic.
* Add the `Data.Functor.Invariant.Day` module, which combines the covariant and
  contravariant versions of `Day`. As a result, `kan-extensions` now depends on
  the `invariant` package.
* Add a `wrapCodensity` function.
* More efficient `Eq1`, `Ord1`, and `Adjunction` instances for `Coyoneda`.
* Add `INLINE` pragmas on more functions.
* Allow building with `containers-0.6`.

5.1 [2018.01.28]
----------------
* Make `Density`, `Codensity`, `Kan` and `Lan` polykinded.
* Add `Eq1`, `Ord1`, `Read1` and `Show1` instances for `Coyoneda` and `Yoneda`.
* Change contexts of `Eq` and `Ord` instances of `Coyoneda` and `Yoneda`
  (and the `Show` instance for `Coyoneda`) to require lifted class instances,
  e.g. `Eq1 f, Eq a`.
* Allow `free-5`.

4.0.3
-----
* Added `liftCoT0M`, `liftCoT1M`, `diter` and `dctrlM` for using `CoT w m` to model a state machine with states in `w` and effects in `m`.

4.0.2
-----
* Made fixes necessary to work around changes in `ImpredicativeTypes` for GHC 7.8.1rc2

4.0.1
-----
* Bug fix so we can compile on GHC 7.4

4.0
---
* Removed `keys` dependency
* Now compatible with `adjunctions` 4.0

3.7
---
* Moved all the `Yoneda` variants around again.
* Improved haddocks

3.6.2
-----
* Added `Data.Functor.Contravariant.Yoneda` to complete the set of Yoneda embeddings/reductions.

3.6.1
-----
* Added several missing isomorphisms

3.6
---
* `instance Monad m => MonadSpec (Yoneda m)`

3.5.1
-----
* Fixed a bug in the signature for `composedRepToCodensity`.

3.5
---
* More combinators for `Rift`/`Lift`.
* Added combinators for working with representable functors rather than just adjoint functors.
* Split `Data.Functor.KanExtension` into `Data.Functor.Kan.Ran` and `Data.Functor.Kan.Lan`
* Split `Data.Functor.KanLift` into `Data.Functor.Kan.Rift` and `Data.Functor.Kan.Lift`
* Moved from `Data.Functor.Yoneda.Contravariant` to `Data.Functor.Yoneda.Reduction` adopting terminology from Todd Trimble.
* Added various missing isomorphisms.
* Greatly improved the Haddocks for this package stating laws and derivations where we can (especially for 'Rift' and 'Ran').

3.3
---
* Rift is now `Applicative`. Added `rap`.

3.2
---
* Added right and left Kan lifts under `Data.Functor.KanLift`.
* Decreased reliance on the `Composition` class where unnecessary in the API

3.1.2
-----
* Marked modules `Trustworthy` as required for `SafeHaskell` in the presence of these extensions.

3.1.1
-----
* Refactored build system
* IRC build-bot notification
* Removed upper bounds on dependencies on my other packages

3.1
---
* Moved `Control.Monad.Free.Church` over to the `free` package instead and removed it from `kan-extensions`
